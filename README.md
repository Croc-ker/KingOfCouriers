This is my capstone project for Neumont College as a part of my Bachelor of Game and Software Development degree.
This project is meant to test all skills I have learned during my stay at this college.

You may not redistribute or claim any assets here as your own.
You may not use my assets in other projects (paid or unpaid) without permission.
You are free to clone this repository for personal or educational use. You may also use individual assets for these uses in addition.
Any external assets I have used will be listed with proper attribution.

Tools and sites I have, will, or am using to develop this project:
Unreal Engine 5.4.x
Blender 4.x
FL Studio Trial ver.
Audacity
freesound.org
CLIP STUDIO PAINT Ver.2

This is King of Couriers, a Hotline Miami and Neon White inspired speedrunning game that features low-poly/PSX/256fes Animal Crossing-esque designs.
Your task is to deliver mail while defeating enemies to maximize your score. Mail can be used to defeat enemies at the cost of losing it, but enemies can be kill-comboed for more points
than simply delivering mail. Each level is a bite-sized puzzle, essentially, and you must find the perfect route between delivering and killing to maximize your score and time.



By the end of the capstone period, this project will be in beta and this repo will no longer be updated.
Also, hi Maple!
