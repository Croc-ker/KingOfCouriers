This is my capstone project for Neumont College as a part of my Bachelor of Science in Game and Software Development degree.

This project is meant to test all skills I have learned during my stay at this college.

	King of Couriers: a Hotline Miami and Neon White inspired game with low-poly/PSX/256fes Animal Crossing-esque designs.

	Your task is to deliver mail while defeating enemies to maximize your score.
	
	Mail can be used to defeat enemies at the cost of losing it, but enemies can be kill-comboed for more points

	than simply delivering mail. 
	
	Each level is a short puzzle to find the perfect route to deliver mail and kill enemies to perfect your score and time.

By the end of the capstone period, this project will be in beta and this repo will no longer be updated (it will be platformed on Steam for money as a beta).

No console ports planned as of now.

Also, hi Maple!
